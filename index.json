CodeBERT is one such pre-trained model for natural language (NL) and programming language (PL) which captures the semantics in natural language and programming language, and produces general-purpose representations. While it has been shown to support natural language code search and code documentation generation tasks, its effectiveness for code clone detection is not explored in depth. In this paper, we aim to replicate and evaluate the performance of CodeBERT for code clone detection on multiple datasets with varying functionalities to understand (1) whether CodeBERT can generalize to unseen code, (2) how fine-tuning can effect CodeBERT’s performance on unseen code, and (3) how CodeBERT performs for detecting various code clone types. To this end, we consider three different datasets of Java methods. We derive the first dataset from Big-CloneBench. We use Java clone pairs from SemanticCloneBench to derive our second dataset, and our third dataset consists of Java methods from Android applications. Our experiments indicate that CodeBERT performs the best for detecting Type-1 and Type-4 clones with a 100% and 96% recall on average respectively. We also find that there is limited generalizability on unseen functionalities where recall drops by 15% and 40% on the SemanticCloneBench and Android datasets respectively. Furthermore, we observe that fine-tuning can improve the recall by 22% and 30% on the SemanticCloneBench and Android datasets respectively.","tags":[],"title":"CodeBERT for Code Clone Detection: A Replication Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shamsa Abid; Hamid Abdul Basit; Shafay Shamail"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1667766181,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1667766181,"objectID":"291d718278e54dc53e2426de9d028f01","permalink":"https://shamsa-abid.github.io/publication/pub_contextfacer/","publishdate":"2022-11-07T01:23:01+05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pub_contextfacer/","section":"publication","summary":"Developers spend a lot of time online, searching for code to help them implement their desired features. While code recommenders help improve developers’ productivity, there is currently no support for context-aware code recommendation for opportunistic code reuse on-the-go. Typical code recommendation systems provide recommendations against a search query, whereas a code recommender that supports opportunistic reuse can recommend related code snippets that represent features that the developer may want to implement next. In this paper, we present a novel Context-aware Feature-driven API usage-based Code Recommender (CA-FACER) tool, which is an Intellij IDEA plugin that leverages a developer’s development context to recommend related code snippets. We consider the methods having API usages in a developer’s active project as part of the development context. Our approach uses contextual data from a developer’s active project to find similar projects and recommends code from popular features of those projects. The popular features are identified as frequently occurring API usage based Method Clone Classes. From our experimental evaluation on 120 Android Java projects from GitHub, we observe a 46% improvement of precision using our proposed context-aware approach over a baseline system. Our technique recommends related code examples with an average precision (P@5) of 94% and 83% and a success rate of 90% and 95% for initial and evolved development stages respectively.

The detection of semantic code clones has important applications in aspect mining and product line analysis. The accurate detection of semantic code clones is a challenging task and various techniques have been proposed. However, the evaluation of these techniques is performed using various datasets and we do not have a clear picture of the performance of these techniques relative to each other. Recently, SemanticCloneBench has been introduced as a benchmark for semantic clones. Now, we can use the SemanticCloneBench to effectively evaluate and compare the performance of semantic code clone detection techniques. In this paper, we compare the semantic code clone detection performance of three different code clone detection techniques namely FACER-CD, CodeBERT and NIL for Java code clones using SemanticCloneBench. FACER-CD performs API usage similarity-based clustering to detect clones, while CodeBERT is a deep-learning based approach which uses a pre-trained programming language model, and NIL is a token-based large-gapped code clones detector. FACER-CD, NIL, and CodeBERT show a recall of 64.3%, 12.7%, and 83.2% respectively on SemanticCloneBench. Using all three techniques together on the SemanticCloneBench dataset gives us an overall recall of 95.5% which is currently the best performance achieved on SemanticCloneBench.","tags":[],"title":"A Comparative Analysis of Clone Detection Techniques on SemanticCloneBench","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maha Kamal; Ayman Abaid; Shamsa Abid; Shafay Shamail"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1638476581,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638476581,"objectID":"fbf2f1cdf88dc3f847ae7036affbdcbb","permalink":"https://shamsa-abid.github.io/publication/facer-as/","publishdate":"2021-12-03T01:23:01+05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/facer-as/","section":"publication","summary":"Android developers often need to search for example code to complete their development tasks. While existing code search systems for Android can deliver code against a search query, they do not recommend code for features that a developer might later need to implement. In this paper, we present FACER-AS (FACER for Android Studio); an Android Studio plugin, which uses FACER (Feature-driven API usage-based Code Examples Recommender) as its back-end code search and recommendation engine. FACER provides relevant code against natural language queries (Stage 1) and also recommends code of multiple related features (Stage 2) to facilitate opportunistic code reuse. To evaluate FACER-AS, we perform a user study involving one professional Android developer who uses our tool for the development of their ongoing live Android projects. We analyze the developer's usage of our tool over a span of seven days and find that FACER-AS achieves a 79% success rate for retrieving code against user queries (Stage 1) and a 41% success rate for recommending code for related features (Stage 2). We also observe a 43% reuse rate of Stage 1 recommendations and a 45% reuse rate of Stage 2 recommendations.

Often, the timely discovery of a critical piece of information can have a dramatic impact on productivity. Current code search systems focus on providing code against a specific user query and repeated searches need to be performed until the code for the desired feature or set of features is found. The problem of repeated code searches needs to be addressed and a solution is desired for helping developers to get the code for related features, thus enabling opportunistic reuse for increased developer productivity. We propose FACER (Feature-driven API usage-based Code Examples Recommender), a recommendation system that provides developers with method recommendations having functionality relevant to their feature or development task.

Existing code search techniques typically focus on finding code snippets for a single given query, which means that developers need to perform a separate search for each desired functionality. In this paper, we propose FACER (Feature-driven API usage-based Code Examples Recommender, a technique that avoids repeated searches through opportunistic reuse. Specifically, given the selected code snippet that matches the initial search query, FACER finds and suggests related code snippets that represent features that the developer may want to implement next. FACER first constructs a code fact repository by parsing the source code of open-source Java projects to obtain methods' textual information, call graphs, and Application Programming Interface (API) usages. It then detects unique features by clustering methods based on similar API usages, where each cluster represents a feature or functionality. Finally, it detects frequently co-occurring features across projects using frequent pattern mining and recommends related methods from the mined patterns. To evaluate FACER, we run it on 120 Java Android apps from GitHub. We first manually validate that the detected method clusters represent methods with similar functionality. We then perform an automated evaluation to determine the best parameters (e.g., similarity threshold) for FACER. We recruit 10 professional developers along with 39 experienced students to judge FACER's recommendation of related methods. Our results show that, on average, FACER's recommendations are 80% precise. We also survey a total of 20 professional Android and Java developers to understand their code search and reuse experiences, and also to obtain their feedback on the usability and usefulness of FACER. The survey results show that 95% of our surveyed professional developers find the idea of related method recommendations useful during code reuse.","tags":[],"title":"FACER: An API Usage-based Code-example Recommender for Opportunistic Reuse","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shamsa Abid"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1565568000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565568000,"objectID":"018f980517687c2bb2377d5357c77b8d","permalink":"https://shamsa-abid.github.io/publication/pub_facer/","publishdate":"2019-11-29T15:38:16+05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pub_facer/","section":"publication","summary":"Developers need to be able to find reusable code for desired software features in a way that supports opportunistic programming for increased developer productivity.

We perform content-based retrieval by using a developer's domain keywords to retrieve only matching projects and their associated design patterns-based code (as design pattern usage examples) from the fact repository.
